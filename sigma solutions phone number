Typically, funds for a personal loan arrive within a week, but your loan may be funded faster, depending on the type of lender and how quickly you move through the application steps.

There are three main steps to getting a personal loan: application, approval and loan disbursement.

Applying for a loan can take minutes. Many lenders let you pre-qualify online first to check rates. You’ll enter your personal and financial information, plus the reason for the loan and your desired amount. If approved, you’ll submit a formal application.

Several lenders make same-day approvals, but this process may take longer if the lender requests more documents. You’ll undergo a hard credit check so the lender can determine your creditworthiness.
 
Once approved, the lender will send funds to your bank account, which can take up to a few days.
