Banks can take up to a week to process a loan application and deliver funds, but some banks can approve and fund a loan more quickly if youâ€™re an existing customer. While many banks let you apply online, your local bank may require an in-person visit to apply or close the loan.

Banks typically require borrowers to have good credit scores (690 and above) for personal loans and may offer lower interest rates or special discounts to customers in good standing.
